# ECG Disease Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to build an end-to-end pipeline for disease classification from raw ECG signals.  
It integrates two models:
1. **CNN Model** – learns directly from raw ECG signals (P wave, T wave, QRS complex).  
2. **NLP/Feature-based Model** – classifies diseases based on extracted ECG waveform features.
